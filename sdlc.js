// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Step 1: Planning
// Step 2: Analysis of Requirements
// Step 3: Design
// Step 4: Implementation
// Step 5: Testing & Integration
// Step 6: Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Focus on functional requirements, user needs, solution analysis"

const design = "Core specifications, features, functions and flow to meet requirements. Make it pretty. "

const implementation = "Building model, constructing code with appropriate programming language "

const testingAndIntegration = "Testing with pre-planned scenarios as part of software design and coding. Deploy the software for use and responding to and resolving user problems. "

const maintain = "Managing and measuring the project to maintain quality and delivery over the application lifecycle, and to evaluate the development process with models such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). "
